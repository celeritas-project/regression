# Celeritas regression repository

This repository is for managing the history of a suite of test problems in
Celeritas to track whether the code is able to run to completion without
hitting an assertion, how the code input options (and processed output) change
over time, and how the kernel occupancy requirements change in response to
growing code complexity.  For more detailed analysis of performance and
accuracy, see the [benchmarks
repo](https://github.com/celeritas-project/benchmarks).

The table is derived from https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas/issues/460 .
